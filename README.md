# voc-games

**This project consists of two games: Hangman and Speedtranslate.**

## Hangman

We built a classic hangman game with Python. The user has to guess simple english vocabulary items. You also can show the german translation as a help. Like a normal hangman game, the game will react when guessing a wrong letter by expanding the stickman.

## Speedtranslate

Besides hangman we also made a new game named _speedtranslate_. It's very similiar to hangman. The goal is to translate a number of voc items from/to english in a specific time, e.g.

```in Betracht ziehen -> consider```
